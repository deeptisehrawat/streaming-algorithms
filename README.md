# streaming-algorithms
Implemented three streaming algorithms:
<br/>
Using the first two algorithms, we will generate a simulated data stream with the Yelp dataset and implement Bloom Filtering and 
Flajolet-Martin algorithm. 
<br/>
In the third one, we did some analysis using Fixed Size Sample (Reservoir Sampling).
